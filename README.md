# sms-filter-nlp
An SMS Filter and Classification Project leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project uses feature engineering, text preprocessing, and machine learning to classify messages as Spam or Ham. It demonstrates tokenization, vectorization, and pipeline creation for streamlined text analysis and classification.

# SMS Filter and Classifier ðŸš€

## Overview
This project aims to classify SMS messages into **Spam** or **Ham** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The focus is on building a streamlined classification pipeline with tokenization, vectorization, and Naive Bayes for effective text analysis.

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: Gained insights into SMS data patterns.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Applied tokenization and cleaned data for NLP tasks.
- **Vectorization**: Leveraged **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF** to extract meaningful features.
- **Pipeline Development**: Created a custom pipeline integrating vectorization and model training.
- **Sparsity Analysis**: Calculated text vector sparsity for performance tuning.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** for model building and pipelines
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for plotting

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aniket1103200/sms-filter-nlp.git
